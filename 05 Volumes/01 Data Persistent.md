### Data Persistent

---

Containers are ephemeral by design. This is not a limitation of the container, more of a design goal. This is the idea of immutable infrastructure, we do not change things once system is running. For changes, we redeploy the whole new container. But the tradeoff is the dataset, generated by the app itself. If we redeploy the whole container the unique dataset inside the container will be lost.

The `separation of concern` suggest, we should not mix the data set with the application binaries. Docker gives us two big favors here,

- Data Volumes (Special location outside the Union file system, docker sees this a local file)
- Bind Mounts (Mount a host directory file into docker container)
